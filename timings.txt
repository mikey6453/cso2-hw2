# Timings Summary

This file contains the time estimates for each scenario measured by the program. The measurements are output by the program and 
have been converted to time estimates for each scenario. The units used for these estimates are nanoseconds (ns). Each scenario 
was ran 100 times and had their average taken. The overhead was accounted for by measuring the time taken to execute an empty 
loop and then subtracting this from the time taken to execute the loop that includes the function call. This is done in the 
measure_ functions.

The overhead was 


## Time Estimates

- Scenario 1: 0 ns
- Scenario 2: 145 ns
- Scenario 3: 1,919,550 ns
- Scenario 4: 15,500 ns
- Scenario 5: 71,190 ns

## Conversion of Measurements to Time Estimates

The program outputs the measurements in nanoseconds. Therefore, no conversion was necessary to convert the measurements to time estimates.
